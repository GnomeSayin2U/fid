In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. <i>Bon Appetit!</i></p><p>The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.</p><p>If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at jen@example.com.</p><p><a href="index.html">Back to Jen's kitchen page</a></p><p><a href="../index.html">Back to Home Page</a></p></body></html>
